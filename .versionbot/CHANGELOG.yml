                Node 14 may well still work with the SDK for

                against them since they are now
                characterized as EOL, and it's quite possible
                that it may stop working entirely in any future

                        Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses,
                        since (very rarely)

                        servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are
                        still accepted

                        by common browsers.


                        Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

                        this would mean the UI nginx would respond with
                        the page not found page, and that content would
                        have ended up being saved as the token.

                Node 10 may well still work with the SDK for quite a
                while, but we'll no longer actively test against them
                since they are now characterized as EOL, and it's
                quite possible that it may stop working entirely in any
                future release.

                        Be more lenient with decoding compressed responses,
                        since (very rarely)

                        servers send slightly invalid gzip responses that are
                        still accepted

                        by common browsers.


                        Always using Z_SYNC_FLUSH is what cURL does.

                Setting a 3-digit semver to the release.semver field
                is the suggested approach, instead of setting the
                release.release_version field. This fixes the unique
                constraint issue that release_version was often
                causing to users, since in case a duplicate semver is
                provided, the backend will auto-increment the
                revision field of the release. A composite
                release.version field is also added, which has a raw
                field with the complete unique version of the release.

      body: |
        This was only caught when we started correctly naming
        the preload container by switching from `Name` to `name` in
        our createContainer options.

        Previously we were creating two containers but they had unique
        random names so we never saw the conflict.

                The change type is considered 'major' because, by default,
                errors are

                now thrown for relatively common occurrences such as
                authentication

                failures when pulling from private registries, and library users
                may

                have to adapt.

        The preloader container is built on the user's system. On
        Windows, the files don't retain their executable flags,
        thus the preloader Python script can't be started just
        by running the script. Now explicitly running the script
        with `python3`, so whether or not the script is executable,
        it will run.

        When attaching to a docker container, docker will buffer
        the standard input/output. On Windows the script seemed to hang
        as the reply from the preloader container might be quite small,
        thus docker just keeps waiting for more data before giving it
        to the program that attached to it. Flushing stdout seems to
        have the desired effect and the caller receives the reply
        from the preloader.

        * use a configured resin-sdk object for resin api connection options;

        * download layer sizes in parallel + avoid downloading layer sizes more

        * transfer appData from js to python inside Docker via an env var =>
        python no longer needs to talk to the api, less requests.

        * resize the rootfs of the outer image for flasher type images

        * resize and preload into the inner image

        * Use docker cached volumes if Docker API Version is >= 1.28 to speed up
        preloading on macOS

        As the uncompressed image layer size cannot be obtained through the
        docker registry (because the layers' identity encoding is a tarball),
        and the registry exposes no methods to otherwise do so, we needed to
        come up with a way to estimate the full container size.
        This calculates the container size by fetching each layers' blob's last
        4 bytes, which are the ISIZE field of the gzip stream, denoting the
        uncompressed size of the stream, and adds up all layer sizes.
        NOTE: This method is not reliable for containers with image layers
        that are 4GB or larger in size, as the gzip ISIZE field is a uint32,
        and the uncompressed size is thus storead as `mod 2^32`, which in turn
        will result in the size of a 4GB layer being calculated as being zero.

        This enables e2fsck to automatically repair issues that can safely
        be fixed without human interaction, allowing the preloader to fail
        properly if the file system is corrupted.
        Previously e2fsck would print that it needs human interaction and
        allow the preloader to continue, causing out-of-disk-space errors
        if subsequently, the filesystem could not be expanded.
